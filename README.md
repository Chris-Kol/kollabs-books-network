# Kollabs Books Network (kollabs-books-network)
This project is our playground for implementing new technologies and sharing those experiments with our dev buddies over at [The Kollabs Chronicle](https://kollabs.dev/). It's like a sandbox, but instead of sand, we've got code. And instead of toys, we've got... well, more code.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Chris-Kol/kollabs-books-network.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```
   cd kollabs-books-network
   ```

3. **Fire up those containers:**
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   docker-compose exec php composer install
   ```

5. **Visit `http://localhost:8000` and bask in the glory of your new book emporium!**

## üõ†Ô∏è What's in the Box?

- PHP 8.3 (because we're living on the edge!)
- Slim Framework (for that svelte figure)
- MySQL (where all our book secrets are stored)
- Nginx (because Apache is so last season)
- Docker (for those "it works on my machine" moments)
